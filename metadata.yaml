description: One world's richest and best-known people in his day, Henry Ford was
  the founder of Ford Motor Company and a pioneering innovator of mass production.
  Ford's autobiography, My Life and Work, gives personal insight into the life of
  this prolific inventor and titan of industry. For the time, Ford awarded high wages
  to his workers despite his driving commitment towards reducing costs, which he did
  instead through the channels of business and technological innovation. Ford's vision
  held consumerism as a cornerstone of global peace and prosperity. In spite of not
  believing in accountants, Ford amassed an enormous wealth, most of which he left
  to the Ford Foundation.
